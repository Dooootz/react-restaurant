--- NOTES ---

containers are essentially small components within main components 
this cleans up our components file - & - accelerates workflow 

assests folder holds iamges & video media - & - exported to the constants folder to be stored in an object

constants folder imports images from the assests folder & stores their value in an object

each component OR container has their own seperate CSS files. - & - organizes our code
